Hello there

I'm Brandon, an entry level software developer currently working on learning full-stack web development as well as learning how to work with new technologies such as smart contracts, Artificial Intellegence, robotics and 3D printing. In the future I would like to work on building blockchain applications and work with technologies such as virtual and augmented reality systems.

I am currently working on my first NFT project with the hopes of gaining knowledge of how to build blockchain games.
